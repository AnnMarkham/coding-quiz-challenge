A timed quiz that stores high scores

## Basic Functionality

When the user clicks the start button a timer is started and the first question is presented.

When a question is answered, it is evaluated to determine whether it is correct.


If it is correct, then correct will be displayed below the question and the next question will appear.  

If the answer is incorrect, "wrong" will be displayed and 10 seconds will be removed from the timer. 

when all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over.  

The highscore is displayed and the user is prompted to enter initials, and submit high score to be stored in external storage.  


The user can then decide whether to clear high scores or go back to the beginning of the quiz.  

At any time during the quiz, the user can click on the highscores link to view the most recently submitted high scores list.
